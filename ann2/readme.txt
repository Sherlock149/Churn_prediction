ann1 with hyperparameter tuning
Number of layers/neurons, learning rate are decided based on hyperparameter tuning using keras_tuner.py

Optimal values are found as:
num_layers: 4
units_0: 14
units_1: 32
learning_rate: 0.0001
units_2: 36
units_3: 6
Score: 0.8690000176429749

Results:
Initial score without tuning: 82.45
After tuning: 86.25
